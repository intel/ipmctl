ipmctl-show-topology(1)
=======================
endif::manpage[]

NAME
----
ipmctl-show-topology - Shows the topology of the memory installed

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
ipmctl show [OPTIONS] -topology [TARGETS]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Shows the topology of the memory installed in the host server. Use the command
ipmctl-show-device to view more detailed information about a DCPMM.

OPTIONS
-------
-a::
-all::
  Shows all attributes.

NOTE: The all and display options are exclusive and may not be used together.

-d (attributes)::
-display (attributes)::
  Filters the returned attributes by explicitly specifying a comma-separated
  list of any of the attributes defined in the Return Data section.

NOTE: The all and display options are exclusive and may not be used together.

-h::
-help::
  Displays help for the command.

-ddrt::
  Used to specify DDRT as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

-smbus::
  Used to specify SMBUS as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

NOTE: The -ddrt and -smbus options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

ifdef::os_build[]
-o (text|nvmxml)::
-output (text|nvmxml)::
  Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".
endif::os_build[]

-u (B|MB|MiB|GB|GiB|TB| TiB)::
-units (B|MB|MiB|GB|GiB|TB| TiB)::
  Changes the units that capacities are displayed in for this command. One of:
  bytes (B), megabytes (MB), mebibytes (MiB), gigabytes (GB), gibibytes (GiB),
  terabytes (TB) or tebibytes (TiB).

TARGETS
-------
-dimm [(DimmIDs)]::
  Restricts output to specific DIMMs by optionally supplying the DIMM target and one or
  more comma-separated DIMM identifiers. The default is to display all DIMMs.

-socket (SocketIDs)::
  Restricts output to the DIMMs installed on specific sockets by supplying the
  socket target and one or more comma-separated socket identifiers. The default
  is to display all sockets.

NOTE: If ACPI PMTT table is not present, then DDR4 memory will not be
displayed in the filtered socket list.

EXAMPLES
--------
Displays the system memory topology.
[verse]
ipmctl show -topology

RETURN DATA
-----------
Displays a table with the attributes listed below for each memory DIMM installed
in the host server.

MemoryType::
  (Default) The DIMM type. One of:
  - Unknown
  - DDR4
  - Logical Non-volatile Device

Capacity::
  (Default) The raw capacity of the DIMM as reported in the SMBIOS Type 17
  table.

DimmID::
  (Default) The DIMM identifier. For DRAM DIMMs, the DimmID is "N/A".

PhysicalID::
  (Default) The DIMM physical identifier (i.e., SMBIOS Type 17 handle).

DeviceLocator::
  (Default) The string that identifies the physically-labeled socket or board
  position where the DIMM is located.

SocketID::
  The processor socket identifier (i.e., NUMA node) where the DIMM is installed.
  For DRAM DIMMs, the socket identifier is "N/A".

MemControllerID::
  The associated memory controller identifier. For DRAM DIMMs, the memory
  controller identifier is "N/A".

ChannelID::
  The associated channel. For DRAM DIMMs, the channel identifier is "N/A".

ChannelPos::
  The DIMM position in the channel. For DRAM DIMMs, the channel position
  identifier is "N/A".

NodeControllerID::
  The node controller identifier. For DRAM DIMMs, the node controller identifier
  is "N/A".

BankLabel::
  The string that identifies the physically-labeled bank where the DIMM is
  located.
