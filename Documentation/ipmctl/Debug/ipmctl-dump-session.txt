NAME
----
ipmctl-dump-session - Dumps content captured during
a recording session.  Captured content includes ACPI,
SMBIOS tables, and FIS requests and responses.
The resulting session file that is generated can be
used to playback commands recorded on a real platform
in a simulated environment, making it possible to debug
issues offline.

SYNOPSIS
