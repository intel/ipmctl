==========================
endif::manpage[]

NAME
----
ipmctl-show-performance - Shows performance metrics for one or more PMem modules

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
ipmctl show [OPTIONS] -performance [METRICS] [TARGETS]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Shows performance metrics for one or more PMem modules.

OPTIONS
-------
-h::
-help::
  Displays help for the command.

-ddrt::
  Used to specify DDRT as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

-smbus::
  Used to specify SMBUS as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

NOTE: The -ddrt and -smbus options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

ifdef::os_build[]
-o (text|nvmxml)::
-output (text|nvmxml)::
  Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".
endif::os_build[]

METRICS
-------
Restricts output to a specific performance metric by supplying the metric name.
See RETURN DATA for more information. One of:

  - MediaReads
  - MediaWrites
  - ReadRequests
  - WriteRequests
  - TotalMediaReads
  - TotalMediaWrites
  - TotalReadRequests
  - TotalWriteRequests

The default is to display all performance metrics.

TARGETS
-------
-dimm [DimmIDs]::
  Restricts output to the performance metrics for specific PMem module by supplying
  one or more comma separated PMem module identifiers. The default is to display
  performance metrics for all manageable PMem module.


EXAMPLES
--------
Shows all performance metrics for all PMem modules in the server.
[verse]
ipmctl show -dimm -performance

Shows the number of 64 byte reads since last AC cycle for all PMem modules in the
server.
[verse]
ipmctl show -dimm -performance MediaReads

LIMITATIONS
-----------
In order to successfully execute this command:

- The caller must have the appropriate privileges.

- The specified PMem modules must be manageable by the host software.

RETURN DATA
-----------
This command displays a table of the specified metrics for each specified PMem module.
Applying a specific PMem module target limits the rows in the table. Applying a
specific metric name target limits the columns in the table.

DimmID::
  The PMem module identifier

MediaReads::
  Number of 64 byte reads from media on the PMem module since last AC cycle.

MediaWrites::
  Number of 64 byte writes to media on the PMem module since last AC cycle.

ReadRequests::
  Number of DDRT read transactions the PMem module has serviced since last AC cycle.

WriteRequests::
  Number of DDRT write transactions the PMem module has serviced since last AC cycle.

TotalMediaReads::
  Number of 64 byte reads from media on the PMem module over its lifetime.

TotalMediaWrites::
  Number of 64 byte writes to media on the PMem module over its lifetime.

TotalReadRequest::
  Number of DDRT read transactions the PMem module has serviced over its lifetime.

TotalWriteRequest::
  Number of DDRT write transactions the PMem module has serviced over its lifetime.
