NAME
----
ipmctl-show-sensor - Shows sensor data for one or more PMem modules

SYNOPSIS
--------
[listing]
--
ipmctl show [OPTIONS] -sensor [SENSORS] [TARGETS]
--

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Shows sensor data for one or more PMem modules. This data includes PMem module health, temperatures,
percentage remaining, up-time and more.

OPTIONS
-------
-a::
-all::
  Shows all attributes.

NOTE: The all and display options are exclusive and may not be used together.

-d (attributes)::
-display (attributes)::
  Filters the returned attributes by explicitly specifying a comma separated
  list of any of the attributes defined in the Return Data section.

NOTE: The all and display options are exclusive and may not be used together.

-h::
-help::
  Displays help for the command.

-ddrt::
  Used to specify DDRT as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

-smbus::
  Used to specify SMBUS as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

NOTE: The -ddrt and -smbus options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

ifdef::os_build[]
-o (text|nvmxml)::
-output (text|nvmxml)::
  Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".
endif::os_build[]

SENSORS
-------
Health::
  (Default) The current PMem module health as reported in the SMART log. Attributes include:
  * DimmID
  * Type
  * CurrentValue

MediaTemperature::
  (Default) The current PMem module media temperature in Celsius. Attributes include:
  * DimmID
  * Type
  * CurrentValue
  * AlarmThreshold
  * AlarmEnabled
  * ThrottlingStopThreshold
  * ThrottlingStartThreshold
  * ShutdownThreshold
  * MaxTemperature

ControllerTemperature::
  (Default) The current PMem module controller temperature in Celsius. Attributes include:
  * DimmID
  * Type
  * CurrentValue
  * AlarmThreshold
  * AlarmEnabled
  * ThrottlingStopThreshold
  * ThrottlingStartThreshold
  * ShutdownThreshold
  * MaxTemperature

PercentageRemaining::
  (Default) Remaining PMem module’s life as a percentage value of factory expected
  life span. Attributes include:
  * DimmID
  * Type
  * CurrentValue
  * AlarmThreshold
  * AlarmEnabled

LatchedDirtyShutdownCount::
  (Default) The number of shutdowns without notification over the lifetime of
  the PMem module. Attributes include:
  * DimmID
  * Type
  * CurrentValue

UnlatchedDirtyShutdownCount::
  (Default) The number of shutdowns without notification over the lifetime of
  the PMem module. This counter is the same as LatchedDirtyShutdownCount except it will
  always be incremented on a dirty shutdown, even if Latch System Shutdown Status
  was not enabled. Attributes include:
  * DimmID
  * Type
  * CurrentValue

PowerOnTime::
  (Default) The total power-on time over the lifetime of the PMem module. Attributes include:
  * DimmID
  * Type
  * CurrentValue

UpTime::
  (Default) The total power-on time since the last power cycle of the PMem module. Attributes include:
  * DimmID
  * Type
  * CurrentValue

PowerCycles::
  (Default) The number of power cycles over the lifetime of the PMem module. Attributes include:
  * DimmID
  * Type
  * CurrentValue

FwErrorCount::
  (Default) The total number of firmware error log entries. Attributes include:
  * DimmID
  * Type
  * CurrentValue

TARGETS
-------
-dimm [DimmIDs]::
  Restricts output to the sensors on specific PMem modules by supplying the DIMM
  target and one or more comma separated PMem module identifiers. The default is to
  display sensors for all manageable PMem modules.

EXAMPLES
--------
Gets all sensor information for all PMem modules.
[listing]
--
ipmctl show -sensor
--

Shows the media temperature sensor for the specified PMem module.
[listing]
--
ipmctl show -sensor MediaTemperature -dimm 0x0001
--

LIMITATIONS
-----------
In order to successfully execute this command:

* The caller must have the appropriate privileges.

* The specified PMem modules must be manageable by the host software.

RETURN DATA
-----------
This command displays a table with a row for each sensor on each PMem module. Applying
a specific PMem module or sensor type target limits the number of rows. Applying
options can be used to expand or restrict the output.

NOTE: Supported thresholds for a given sensor are listed as a part of the return data when using the -all or -display flag. Only the alarm threshold is settable.

DimmID::
  (Default) The PMem module identifier

Type::
  (Default) The sensor type. Refer to the sensor table above.

CurrentValue::
  (Default) The current reading followed by the units of measurement
  (e.g., 57 °C or 25%)

AlarmThreshold::
  The threshold value at which an alarm for the respective sensor will be triggered.

AlarmEnabled::
  Current state of the alarm threshold, where applicable.
  One of:
  * 0: Disabled
  * 1: Enabled
  * N/A

ThrottlingStopThreshold::
  The threshold value at which firmware will stop throttling to reduce overall thermals and keep the PMem module within safe operating temperatures.

ThrottlingStartThreshold::
  The threshold value at which firmware will start throttling to reduce overall thermals and keep the PMem module within safe operating temperatures.

ShutdownThreshold::
  The threshold value at which device shutdown will occur.

MaxTemperature::
  The highest temperature reported in degrees Celsius for a given media or controller sensor.
  This value is persistent through Power Loss and is read-only.
