ipmctl-change-device-passphrase(1)
==================================
endif::manpage[]

NAME
----
ifndef::os_build[]
ipmctl-change-device-passphrase - Changes the security passphrase on DCPMM
endif::os_build[]
ifdef::os_build[]
ipmctl-change-device-passphrase - Changes the security passphrase on DCPMM on supported OS
endif::os_build[]

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
ipmctl set [OPTIONS] -dimm [TARGETS] Passphrase=(string) NewPassphrase=(string)
ConfirmPassphrase=(string)

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Changes the security passphrase on one or more DCPMMs.

ifdef::os_build[]
NOTE: This command is subject to OS Vendor (OSV) support. It will return "Not Supported."
endif::os_build[]

OPTIONS
-------
-h::
-help::
  Displays help for the command.

-ddrt::
  Used to specify DDRT as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

-smbus::
  Used to specify SMBUS as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

NOTE: The -ddrt and -smbus options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

-master::
  Changes the master passphrase. Valid only if master passphrase is enabled on specified
  DCPMMs (see MasterPassphraseEnabled attribute in section <<Show Device>>).

-default::
  Use this option when the current master passphrase is set to the default value. Valid
  only if used along with the '-master' option. May not be combined with the Passphrase
  property.

-source (path)::
  File path to a local file containing the new passphrase (1-32 characters).

NOTE: The file does not need to contain the ConfirmPassphrase property

TARGETS
-------
-dimm [DimmIDs]::
  Changes the passphrase on specific DCPMMs by supplying one or more
  comma separated DCPMM identifiers. However, this is not recommended as
  it may put the system in an undesirable state. The default is to change the
  passphrase on all manageable DCPMMs.

PROPERTIES
----------
Passphrase::
The current passphrase (1-32 characters). For better passphrase protection, specify an
empty string (e.g., Passphrase="") to be prompted for the current passphrase or to use
a file containing the passphrases with the source option.

NewPassphrase::
  The new passphrase (1-32 characters). For better passphrase protection,
  specify an empty string (e.g., NewPassphrase="") to be prompted for the
  passphrase or to use a file containing the passphrase with the source option.

ConfirmPassphrase::
  Confirmation of the new passphrase (1-32 character and must match
  NewPassphrase). For better passphrase protection, specify an empty string
  (e.g., ConfirmPassphrase="") to be prompted for the passphrase or to use a
  file containing the passphrase with the source option.

EXAMPLES
--------
Changes the passphrase from mypassphrase to mynewpassphrase on all DCPMMs.

[verse]
ipmctl set -dimm Passphrase=mypassphrase NewPassphrase=mynewpassphrase
 ConfirmPassphrase=mynewpassphrase

Changes the passphrase on all DCPMMs by having the CLI prompt for the
current and new passphrases.
[verse]
ipmctl set -dimm Passphrase="" NewPassphrase="" ConfirmPassphrase=""

Changes the passphrase on all DCPMMs by supplying the current and new
passphrases from the specified file. In this example, the format of the file
would be:

#ascii +
Passphrase=myOldPassphrase +
NewPassphrase=myNewPassphrase
[verse]
ipmctl set -source passphrase.file -dimm Passphrase="" NewPassphrase=""
ConfirmPassphrase=""

Changes the default master passphrase to masterpassphrase on all DCPMMs.

[verse]
ipmctl set -master -default NewPassphrase=masterpassphrase ConfirmPassphrase=
masterpassphrase

Changes the master passphrase from masterpassphrase to newmasterpassphrase on
all DCPMMs.

[verse]
ipmctl set -master -dimm Passphrase=masterpassphrase NewPassphrase=newmasterpassphrase
ConfirmPassphrase=newmasterpassphrase

LIMITATIONS
-----------
In order to successfully execute this command:

- The caller must have the appropriate privileges.

- The specified DCPMM must be manageable by the host software, have
  security enabled and not be in the "Frozen" or "Exceeded" lock states.

ifdef::os_build[]
Command is subject to OS Vendor (OSV) support. If OSV does not provide support,
command will return "Not Supported."
endif::os_build[]

RETURN DATA
-----------
If empty strings are provided for the passphrase properties and the source
option is not included, the user will be prompted (once for all DCPMM) to enter
the current passphrase, then again for the new passphrase and then again to
confirm the new passphrase as described below. The passphrase characters are
hidden.

Current passphrase: \****

For each DIMM, the CLI will indicate the status of the passphrase change
operation. If a failure occurs when updating the passphrase on multiple DCPMMs,
the process will exit and not continue updating the remaining DCPMMs.

SAMPLE OUTPUT
-------------
[verse]
Change passphrase on DIMM (DimmID): Success

[verse]
Change passphrase on DIMM (DimmID): Error (Code)-(Description)
