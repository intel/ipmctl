=====================

NAME
----
ipmctl-create-goal - Creates a memory allocation goal on one or more DCPMM

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
ipmctl create [OPTIONS] -goal [TARGETS] [PROPERTIES]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Creates a memory allocation goal on one or more for the BIOS to read on the next
reboot in order to map the DCPMM capacity into the system address space.
Persistent memory can then be utilized by creating a namespace.

include::../ipmctl-change-goal-config-warning.txt[]

OPTIONS
-------

-f::
-force::
    Reconfiguring DCPMMs is a destructive operation which requires
    confirmation from the user. This option suppresses the confirmation.

-h::
-help::
    Displays help for the command.

ifdef::os_build[]
-o (text|nvmxml)::
-output (text|nvmxml)::
    Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".
endif::os_build[]

-u (B|MB|MiB|GB|GiB|TB| TiB)::
-units (B|MB|MiB|GB|GiB|TB| TiB)::
    Changes the units that capacities are displayed in for this command. One of:
    bytes (B), megabytes (MB), mebibytes (MiB), gigabytes (GB), gibibytes (GiB),
    terabytes (TB) or tebibytes (TiB).

TARGETS
-------
-dimm [(DimmIDs)]::
    Creates a memory allocation goal on specific DCPMMs by optionally supplying one or
    more comma-separated DCPMM identifiers. This list must include all
    unconfigured DCPMMs on the affected socket(s). The default is to configure
    all manageable DCPMMs on all sockets.

-socket (SocketIds)::
    Creates a memory allocation goal on specific DCPMMs by supplying one or
    more comma-separated DCPMM identifiers. This list must include all
    unconfigured DCPMMs on the affected socket(s). The default is to configure
    all manageable DCPMMs on all sockets.

PROPERTIES
----------
MemoryMode::
    Percentage of the total capacity to use in Memory Mode [underline]#(0-100)#.
    Default = 0.

PersistentMemoryType::
    If MemoryMode is not 100%, the type of persistent memory to create.
    - "AppDirect": (Default) Create App Direct capacity utilizing hardware interleaving across the
    requested DCPMMs if applicable given the specified target.
    - "AppDirectNotInterleaved": Create App Direct capacity that is not interleaved any
    other DCPMMs.

NamespaceLabelVersion::
    The version of the namespace label storage area (LSA) index block
    - "1.2": (Default) Defined in UEFI 2.7a - sections 13.19
    - "1.1": Legacy 1.1 namespace label support

Reserved::
    Reserve a percentage [underline]#(0-100)# of the requested DCPMM capacity
    that will not be mapped into the system physical address space and will be
    presented as Unconfigured Capacity with Show Device and Show Memory
    Resources.

EXAMPLES
--------
Configures all the DCPMM capacity in Memory Mode.
[verse]
ipmctl create -goal MemoryMode=100

Configures all the DCPMM capacity as App Direct.
[verse]
ipmctl create -goal PersistentMemoryType=AppDirect

Configures the capacity on each DCPMM with 20% of the capacity in Memory
Mode and the remaining as App Direct capacity that does not use hardware
interleaving.
[verse]
ipmctl create -goal MemoryMode=20 PersistentMemoryType=AppDirectNotInterleaved

Configures the DCPMM capacity across the entire system with 25% of the
capacity in Memory Mode, 25% reserved and the remaining 50% as App Direct.
Configures the DCPMM capacity across the entire system with 25% of the
capacity in Memory Mode and the remaining 75% as App Direct.
[verse]
ipmctl create -goal MemoryMode=25 PersistentMemoryType=AppDirect Reserved=25

LIMITATIONS
-----------
In order to successfully execute this command:

- The caller must have the appropriate privileges.

- The specified DCPMM(s) must be manageable by the host software and
  must all have the same SKU.

- Existing memory allocation goals that have not been applied and any namespaces
  associated with the requested DCPMM(s) must be deleted before running
  this command.

- Security state must be disabled.
  Changing the memory configuration is a destructive operation which results in loss of
  data stored in the persistent memory region. Therefore, data should be backed up to
  other storage before executing this command.
  Targets may be limited to individual DCPMMs or sockets, but all DCPMMs
  on affected sockets must be configured when the command finishes. If the
  selected targets make this impossible, the command will be rejected.
  Refer to <<2.1.5 Show System Capabilities>> for a list of BIOS
  supported modes.

- Some requests are dependent on BIOS and/or platform configuration. For details, refer
  to the _Intel® Optane™ DC Persistent Memory Software Memory Allocation Rules_,
  document number 564194. For example:
 - Provisioning DCPMMs for Memory Mode while BIOS is configured for 1LM only
   will result in unused capacity.
 - Provisioning DCPMMs for Memory Mode while not all iMCs have at least one DCPMM
   will result in unused capacity.

RETURN DATA
-----------
Minor adjustments (up to 10%) in the requested capacities are sometimes
necessary to align properly according to the platform rules. There are also some
situations that require additional confirmation from the user because they may
result in a non- optimal configuration (i.e., reduced performance).
These are described below.:

*The requested goal may result in a non-optimal configuration due to the
population of DIMMs in the system* +

Memory Mode capacity requested but the population of DRAM DIMMs and DCPMMs in
the system may result in reduced performance (i.e., the ratio of DRAM and DCPMMs
is not balanced, DRAM and DCPMMs are not on the same channel or not all the same
size).

*The requested goal may result in a non-optimal configuration due to
the population of DIMMs in the system.* +
App Direct capacity requested but the population of DCPMMs in the system may
result in reduced performance (i.e., DCPMMs are not the same size or populated
asymmetrically across the socket).

*The requested goal will result in App Direct capacity which is not supported by
the host software.* +
App Direct capacity requested but App Direct is not supported by the currently
installed host software.

*The requested goal will result in Memory Mode capacity that is unusable
with the currently selected platform BIOS volatile mode.* +
Memory Mode capacity requested by the platform BIOS is currently set to 1LM Mode.

*The requested goal was adjusted more than 10% to find a valid configuration.* +
> 10% adjustment from the requested goal

*The amount of mapped memory was limited based on the SKU resulting in un-mapped
capacity.* +
Mapped memory was limited based on the CPU SKU.

Therefore, before making any changes to the configuration, a prompt is displayed
showing the memory allocation goals that will be created on each DCPMM as
documented in the command Section 2.2.6, ‚ "Show Memory Allocation Goal," along
with any additional confirmation messages. The force option can be used to
override this confirmation and proceed directly with creating the goals.

The following configuration will be applied:
SocketID DimmID MemorySize AppDirect1Size AppDirect2Size (Refer to
the command Section 2.2.6, "Show Memory Allocation Goal")
