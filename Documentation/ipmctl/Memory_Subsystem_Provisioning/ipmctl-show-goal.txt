===================

NAME
----
ipmctl-show-goal - Shows the memory allocation goal on one or more DCPMM

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Shows the memory allocation goal on one or more DCPMMs. Once the goal is
successfully applied by the BIOS, it is no longer displayed. Use the command
Section 2.1.4, “Show Memory Resources” to view the system-wide memory resources
or the command Section 2.4.1, “Show Persistent Memory” for detailed persistent
memory information.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
ipmctl show [OPTIONS] -goal [TARGETS] [PROPERTIES]

OPTIONS
-------
-a::
-all::
  Shows all attributes.
   +
  Note: The all and display options are exclusive and may not be used together.

-d (attributes)::
-display (attributes)::
  Filters the returned attributes by explicitly specifying a comma-separated
  list of any of the attributes defined in the Return Data section.
   +
  Note: The all and display options are exclusive and may not be used together.

-h::
-help::
    Displays help for the command.

ifdef::os_build[]
-o (text|nvmxml)::
-output (text|nvmxml)::
    Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".
endif::os_build[]

-u (B|MB|MiB|GB|GiB|TB| TiB)::
-units (B|MB|MiB|GB|GiB|TB| TiB)::
    Changes the units that capacities are displayed in for this command. One of:
    bytes (B), megabytes (MB), mebibytes (MiB), gigabytes (GB), gibibytes (GiB),
    terabytes (TB) or tebibytes (TiB).

TARGETS
-------
-dimm (DimmIDs)::
  Restricts output to specific DCPMMs by supplying one or more comma separated
  DCPMM identifiers. The default is to display all manageable DCPMMs with memory
  allocation goals.

-socket (SocketIds)::
  Restricts output to the DCPMMs on specific sockets by supplying the socket
  target and one or more comma-separated socket identifiers. The default is to
  display all manageable DCPMMs on all sockets with memory allocation goals.

EXAMPLES
--------
Shows the default memory allocation goal attributes for each DCPMM.
[verse]
ipmctl show -goal

Shows all the memory allocation goal attributes for the DCPMMs on socket 1.
[verse]
ipmctl show -a -goal -socket 1

LIMITATIONS
-----------
The specified DCPMMs must be manageable by the host software.

RETURN DATA
-----------
The default behavior is to display a table with the default attributes for each
DCPMM; applying options changes the output to a more detailed format.

SocketID::
  (Default) The processor socket identifier where the DCPMM is installed.

DimmID:: (Default)
  The DCPMM identifier

MemorySize::
  (Default) The DCPMM capacity that will be configured in Memory Mode.

AppDirect1Size::
  (Default) The DCPMM capacity that will be configured as the first App Direct
  interleave set if applicable.

AppDirect1Index::
  Unique identifier of the first App Direct interleave set.
  - N/A: If no App Direct interleave set
  - Numeric value if App Direct interleave set is present.

AppDirect1Settings::
  The settings for the first App Direct interleave set in the format: x(Way)
  [- (Size) iMC] [x (Size) Channel]

AppDirect2Size::
  (Default) The DCPMM capacity that will be configured as the second App
  Direct interleave set if applicable.

AppDirect2Index::
  Unique identifier of the second App Direct interleave set.
  - N/A: If no App Direct interleave set
  - Numeric value if App Direct interleave set is present.

AppDirect2Settings::
  The settings for the second App Direct interleave set in the format: x(Way)
  [- (Size) iMC] [x (Size) Channel]

Status::
The status of the memory allocation goal. One of:
  - Unknown: The status cannot be determined.
  - New: A reboot is required for the memory allocation goal to be processed by
    the BIOS.
  - Failed - Bad request: The BIOS failed to process the memory allocation goal
    because it was invalid.
  - Failed - Not enough resources: There were not enough resources for the BIOS
    to process the memory allocation goal.
  - Failed - Firmware error: The BIOS failed to process the memory allocation
    goal due to a firmware error.
  - Failed - Unknown: The BIOS failed to process the memory allocation goal due
    to an unknown error.

ifdef::os_build[]
ActionRequired::
  (Default) If there are events for the memory allocation goal on this DCPMEM
  that require corrective action or acknowledgment. Refer to the command Show
  Events for more information about events. One of:
  - 0: No action required events
  - 1: One or more action required events

ActionRequiredEvents::
  A list of the events for the memory allocation goal on this DCPMEM that
  require corrective action or acknowledgment in the format: Event [ID] -
  [Message]. Refer to the command Show Events for more information about events.
endif::os_build[]

SAMPLE OUTPUT
-------------
If a new memory allocation goal has been created, a prompt to reboot will be
presented.
[verse]
A reboot is required to process new memory allocation goals.
