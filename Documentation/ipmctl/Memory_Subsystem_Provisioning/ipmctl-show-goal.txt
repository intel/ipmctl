ipmctl-show-goal(1)
===================
endif::manpage[]

NAME
----
ipmctl-show-goal - Shows the memory allocation goal on one or more PMem modules

SYNOPSIS
--------
[listing]
--
ipmctl show [OPTIONS] -goal [TARGETS] [PROPERTIES]
--

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Shows the memory allocation goal on one or more PMem modules. Once the goal is
successfully applied by the platform firmware (BIOS), it is no longer
displayed. Use the command <<Show Memory Resources>> to view
the system-wide memory resources or the command
<<Show Persistent Memory>> for detailed persistent memory information.

OPTIONS
-------
-a::
-all::
  Shows all attributes.

NOTE: The all and display options are exclusive and may not be used together.

-d (attributes)::
-display (attributes)::
  Filters the returned attributes by explicitly specifying a comma separated
  list of any of the attributes defined in the Return Data section.

NOTE: The all and display options are exclusive and may not be used together.

-h::
-help::
    Displays help for the command.

-ddrt::
  Used to specify DDRT as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

-smbus::
  Used to specify SMBUS as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

NOTE: The -ddrt and -smbus options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

ifdef::os_build[]
-o (text|nvmxml)::
-output (text|nvmxml)::
  Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".
endif::os_build[]

-u (B|MB|MiB|GB|GiB|TB| TiB)::
-units (B|MB|MiB|GB|GiB|TB| TiB)::
    Changes the units that capacities are displayed in for this command. One of:
    bytes (B), megabytes (MB), mebibytes (MiB), gigabytes (GB), gibibytes (GiB),
    terabytes (TB) or tebibytes (TiB).

TARGETS
-------
-dimm [DimmIDs]::
  Restricts output to specific PMem modules by supplying one or more comma separated
  PMem module identifiers. The default is to display all manageable PMem modules with memory
  allocation goals.

-socket [SocketIds]::
  Restricts output to the PMem modules on specific sockets by supplying the socket
  target and one or more comma separated socket identifiers. The default is to
  display all manageable PMem modules on all sockets with memory allocation goals.

EXAMPLES
--------
Shows the default memory allocation goal attributes for each PMem module.
[listing]
--
ipmctl show -goal
--

Shows all the memory allocation goal attributes for the PMem modules on socket 1.
[listing]
--
ipmctl show -a -goal -socket 1
--

LIMITATIONS
-----------
In order to successfully execute this command:

* The caller must have the appropriate privileges.

* The specified PMem modules must be manageable by the host software.

RETURN DATA
-----------
The default behavior is to display a table with the default attributes for each
PMem module; applying options changes the output to a more detailed format.

SocketID::
  (Default) The processor socket identifier where the PMem module is installed.

DimmID::
  (Default) The PMem module identifier

MemorySize::
  (Default) The PMem module capacity that will be configured in Memory Mode.

AppDirect1Size::
  (Default) The PMem module capacity that will be configured as the first App Direct
  interleave set if applicable.

AppDirect1Index::
  Unique identifier of the first App Direct interleave set.
  * N/A: If no App Direct interleave set
  * Numeric value if App Direct interleave set is present.

AppDirect1Settings::
  The settings for the first App Direct interleave set in the format: x(Way)
  [- (Size) iMC] [x (Size) Channel]

AppDirect2Size::
  (Default) The PMem module capacity that will be configured as the second App
  Direct interleave set if applicable.

AppDirect2Index::
  Unique identifier of the second App Direct interleave set.
  * N/A: If no App Direct interleave set
  * Numeric value if App Direct interleave set is present.

AppDirect2Settings::
  The settings for the second App Direct interleave set in the format: x(Way)
  [- (Size) iMC] [x (Size) Channel]

Status::
The status of the memory allocation goal. One of:
  * Unknown: The status cannot be determined.
  * New: A reboot is required for the memory allocation goal to be processed by
    the BIOS.
  * Failed - Bad request: The BIOS failed to process the memory allocation goal
    because it was invalid.
  * Failed - Not enough resources: There were not enough resources for the BIOS
    to process the memory allocation goal.
  * Failed - Firmware error: The BIOS failed to process the memory allocation
    goal due to a firmware error.
  * Failed - Unknown: The BIOS failed to process the memory allocation goal due
    to an unknown error.

SAMPLE OUTPUT
-------------
If a new memory allocation goal has been created, a prompt to reboot will be
presented.
