==========================

NAME
----
ipmctl-delete-namespace - Deletes one or more existing namespaces

SYNOPSIS
--------
[listing]
--
ipmctl delete [OPTIONS] -namespace [TARGETS]
--

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Deletes one or more existing namespaces. All data on the deleted namespaces
becomes inaccessible.

NOTE: Changing the namespace configuration is a destructive operation which may
result in loss of data stored in the associated namespace. Therefore, data
should be backed up to other storage before executing this command.

NOTE: Deleting a namespace removes the logical OS mapping to the persistent
memory data, but does not explicitly delete or modify user data found in
persistent memory.


OPTIONS
-------
-f::
-force::
  Deleting namespaces is a destructive operation which requires confirmation
  from the user for each namespace. This option suppresses the confirmation.

-h::
-help::
  Displays help for the command.

-ddrt::
  Used to specify DDRT as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

-smbus::
  Used to specify SMBUS as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

NOTE: The -ddrt and -smbus options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

-lpmb::
  Used to specify large transport payload size for the current invocation of ipmctl.

-spmb::
  Used to specify small transport payload size for the current invocation of ipmctl.

NOTE: The -lpmb and -spmb options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

TARGETS
-------
-namespace [NamespaceIDs]::
  Deletes specific namespaces by providing a comma separated list of one or more
  namespace identifiers. The default is to delete all namespaces. Namespace
  identifiers are limited to 64 characters.

EXAMPLES
--------
Deletes namespace 0x02.

ipmctl delete -namespace 0x2

LIMITATIONS
-----------
In order to successfully execute this command:

* The caller must have the appropriate privileges.

* Any associated file systems must be un-mounted.

* The specified PMem modules must be manageable by the host software and unlocked if
  security is enabled.

RETURN DATA
-----------
For each namespace, the Intel(R) CLI will indicate the status of the operation. If a
failure occurs when deleting multiple namespaces, the process will continue
deleting the remaining namespaces.

SAMPLE OUTPUT
