NAME
----
ipmctl-modify-device - Changes the configurable setting(s) on one or more DCPMMs

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Changes the configurable setting(s) on one or more DCPMMs.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
ipmctl set [OPTIONS] -dimm (DimmIDs) FirstFastRefresh=(0|1)

OPTIONS
-------
-f::
-force::
  Changing DCPMM setting(s) is a potentially destructive operation which
  requires confirmation from the user for each DCPMM. This option suppresses the
  confirmation.

-h::
-help::
  Displays help for the command.

ifdef::os_build[]
-o (text|nvmxml)::
-output (text|nvmxml)::
  Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".
endif::os_build[]

TARGETS
-------
-dimm (DimmIDs)::
  Modifies specific DCPMMs by supplying one or more comma-separated DCPMM
  identifiers. However, this is not recommended as it may put the system in an
  undesirable state. The default is to modify all manageable DCPMMs.

PROPERTIES
----------
FirstFastRefresh=(0|1)::
  Whether acceleration of the first refresh cycle is enabled. One of:
  - 0: Disable - This is the default.
  - 1: Enable - Customers will have to wait a pre-determined time (5-6 minutes)
       before starting benchmark tests.

EXAMPLES
--------
Enables acceleration of the first fast refresh cycle on all manageable DCPMMs
[verse]
set -dimm FirstFastRefresh=1

LIMITATIONS
-----------
The specified DCPMM(s) must be manageable by the host software.

RETURN DATA
-----------
For each DCPMM, the CLI will indicate the status of the operation. If a failure
occurs when modifying multiple DCPMMs, the process will exit and not continue
modifying the remaining DCPMMs.

SAMPLE OUTPUT
-------------
[verse]
Modify DIMM (DimmID): Success
Modify DIMM (DimmID): Error (Code)-(Description)
