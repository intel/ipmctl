/** @file
  Performance library instance used by SMM Core.

  This library provides the performance measurement interfaces and initializes performance
  logging for the SMM phase.
  It initializes SMM phase performance logging by publishing the SMM Performance and PerformanceEx Protocol,
  which is consumed by SmmPerformanceLib to logging performance data in SMM phase.

  This library is mainly used by SMM Core to start performance logging to ensure that
  SMM Performance and PerformanceEx Protocol are installed at the very beginning of SMM phase.

 Caution: This module requires additional review when modified.
 This driver will have external input - performance data and communicate buffer in SMM mode.
 This external input must be validated carefully to avoid security issue like
 buffer overflow, integer overflow.

 SmmPerformanceHandlerEx(), SmmPerformanceHandler() will receive untrusted input and do basic validation.
