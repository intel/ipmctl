  Add or delete routing entries.
  
  The Routes() function adds or deletes a route from the instance's routing table.
  The most specific route is selected by comparing the SubnetAddress with the 
  destination IP address's arithmetical AND to the SubnetMask.
  The default route is added with both SubnetAddress and SubnetMask set to 0.0.0.0. 
  The default route matches all destination IP addresses if there is no more specific route.
  Direct route is added with GatewayAddress set to 0.0.0.0. Packets are sent to 
  the destination host if its address can be found in the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) 
  cache or it is on the local subnet. If the instance is configured to use default 
  address, a direct route to the local network will be added automatically.
  Each TCP instance has its own independent routing table. Instance that uses the 
  default IP address will have a copy of the EFI_IP4_CONFIG_PROTOCOL's routing table. 
  The copy will be updated automatically whenever the IP driver reconfigures its 
  instance. As a result, the previous modification to the instance's local copy 
  will be lost. The priority of checking the route table is specific with IP 
  implementation and every IP implementation must comply with RFC 1122.

  Abort an asynchronous connection, listen, transmission or receive request.

  The Cancel() function aborts a pending connection, listen, transmit or receive 
  request. If Token is not NULL and the token is in the connection, listen, 
  transmission or receive queue when it is being cancelled, its Token->Status 
  will be set to EFI_ABORTED and then Token->Event will be signaled. If the token 
  is not in one of the queues, which usually means that the asynchronous operation 
  has completed, EFI_NOT_FOUND is returned. If Token is NULL all asynchronous token 
  issued by Connect(), Accept(), Transmit() and Receive()will be aborted.
  NOTE: It has not been implemented currently.

  Poll to receive incoming data and transmit outgoing segments.

  The Poll() function increases the rate that data is moved between the network 
  and application and can be called when the TCP instance is created successfully. 
  Its use is optional. In some implementations, the periodical timer in the MNP 
  driver may not poll the underlying communications device fast enough to avoid 
  drop packets. Drivers and applications that are experiencing packet loss should 
  try calling the Poll() function in a high frequency.
